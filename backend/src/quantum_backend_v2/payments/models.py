"""Rail-agnostic payment events and the internal USDC credit ledger (#3).

Every payment rail (x402, cards, Zcash, swaps, on-chain transfers) records a
``PaymentEvent``. Events that move value into the platform's internal credit
system also append ``LedgerEntry`` rows. Balances are never stored as the
source of truth: they are derived by summing an account's entries.
